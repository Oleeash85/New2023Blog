            <p id="bppo">Hi, My name is Ashley. Welcome to my Blog about How I became a Front End Software developer and the things I do to relax or have fun. My journey started from an advertisement on Facebook. They showed a scholarship opportunity through Blacks
                in Technology and OneTen. Since taking this Class I have learned so much. From the basics of HTML to how to decoraate a page or paragraph using CSS. My goal is to daily show y'all how much you can learn in a short period of time. So here's
                to my journey. Hope you learn as much as I have. </p>
